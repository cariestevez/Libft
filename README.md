ðŸ“š This project is my own replica of a set of functions from the libc (standard C library) as well
as some other utility functions that I will use during the rest of the cursus.

The functions will have the same prototypes and implement the same behaviors as the originals.
See [subject](https://github.com/cariestevez/Libft/blob/main/libft.en.subject.pdf)


> [!NOTE]
> Please note that this was my first ever coding project and it hasn't been properly updated since then.
